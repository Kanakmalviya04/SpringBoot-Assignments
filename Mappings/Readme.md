In a Spring Boot project, "Mappings" are used to define how HTTP requests should be handled by the application's controllers.
Here's a simple and short explanation of mappings in a Spring Boot project:

RequestMapping: The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map HTTP requests to controller methods. 
You can specify the URL path and HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that the method should handle.

GetMapping: The @GetMapping annotation is a shorthand for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET). 
It is used when you want to handle only GET requests for a particular URL. For example:

PostMapping: Similarly, you have @PostMapping to handle only POST requests,
@PutMapping for PUT requests, and @DeleteMapping for DELETE requests. Here's an example of @PostMapping:

In this case, any POST request to the URL "/greet" with a request body containing a JSON object like {"name": "John"} will be
handled by the greetUser() method, and it will return the string "Hello, John!" as the response.
